Welcome to BlockWorld!

Blockworld is a block-based voxel game in Python that was written using Pyglet.

I plan for the code to be organized into the form of an engine that hobbyists can use to write their own games. This would probably involve porting to C++,
adding support for 3D objects, and more.

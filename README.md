Welcome to BlockWorld!

Blockworld is a block-based voxel game in Python that was written using Pyglet.
Since Mojave 10.14, Apple has decided to stop supporting OpenGL. As a result, the draw function results in a blank screen, and attempts to run the existing function results in extremely odd and irregular depth buffering. Shame on you, Apple. I'll probably port PyGL to Metal at a later point.
